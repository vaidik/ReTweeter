ReTweeter

ReTweeter is a web application. It makes handling of Twitter
accounts of organisations or open groups easy. With ReTweeter,
many people belonging or associated to the organisation may
submit their tweets on ReTweeter so that maintainers of the 
organisation's Twitter account can review the tweets and post
those tweets on Twitter.

CURRENT STATUS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this version:

* The project is functional.
* The UI is UGLY (sorry for that).

In the coming versions, work will be done majorly:
* On improving the UI.
* On adding more functionality.
* Towards making ReTweeter a more generic software.
